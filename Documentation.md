##DNA mutations
The main target of our projec is to detect teh abnormal DNA mismataches in patterns which ay be a mutation in the DNA, 
### Used Algorithm
We found that the simplest way to construct our code to perfectly do the function we need which is finding the mismatch in the patterns of the genome, is to use data structure and algorithms that were already built specially for searching patterns and construction of the data in a certain way, so we used *suffix arrays* and *Burrows Wheeler Algorithm*.
#### What is suffix array?

### Applications of our algorithm
